# Armed-Vortex

## Sounds Interesting... But What Is This?

Let’s dive into the details, shall we? **Armed-Vortex** is a fully functional AntiCheat for the platform [ROBLOX](https://www.roblox.com) as of [1/18/2025](#). ROBLOX is a neat platform that allows players to create and play "experiences" made by them and others, while this seems like a simple and easy way for kids to have fun while allowing them to create their things, and be creative, it has its downsides. We've seen a lot of cheating on this platform, which typically pushes away players, and commonly frustrates players. Roblox has implemented new Anti-Tamper ideas, which succeeded in removing a majority, there's still cheating, and it only grows with each passing day. With people commonly blaming Roblox for this, it isn't entirely their fault, Anti-Cheats SHOULD be left to the developers of their respective games. However, many people lack the resources and knowledge to tackle these major hurdles, which could present problems for anyone. However, as time goes on, we realize quickly that there's a need for an Anti-Cheat on the market that is free, and completely open-sourced, that's where Jupiter Development comes into play. Jupiter Development has been for some time, working on creating an Anti-Cheat for the public to use as a learning resource, and for real-world use—engineering solutions for owners and game developers alike. 

## Okay, But How Does This Relate?

Creating an Anti-Cheat is often considered complex by those who are limited in resources and knowledge, but considered easy for those who don't have those very same resources, even for basic Anti-Cheat measures. Here's where Armed-Vortex comes in as a factor, its a fully open-sourced and working Anti-Cheat built directly for the ROBLOX community and developer communities alike, Jupiter Development is a strong believer in the open source community and complies fully with them for many reasons:

  1. To prevent exploits in games where the game owner or developers lack knowledge experience or resources to build an Anti-Cheat themselves.
  2. To offer a free universal Anti-Cheat option while being free and competing with even the paid Anti-Cheats, we offer a free and universal one to help benefit members of the community.
  3. We empower the users to spend less time searching and more time cheat free.

## What's the Catch?

While this might be currently (from what I've seen) one of the best-open-sourced anti-cheats, Jupiter Development still deserves credit for their work, thus adding us to your credits would be kind and the only catch. Jupiter has developers at all times in mind, and we believe everyone should have access to what we have made, and should have free access to these resources.
